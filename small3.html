    <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        ::marker
        "They're useful for displaying lists of stuff"</li>
        <li>
        ::marker
        "That's about it"
        </li>
        <li>
        ::marker
        "I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool"
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
          ::marker
          "Decide if it's an ordered list or not"
        </li>
        <li>
          ::marker
          "If it's no an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag"
          </li>
         <ul>
          </li>
            ::marker
            "Use li tags nested in the list your list items"
        </li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            ::marker
            "Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other"
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <li>
      ::marker
      "You've got this, I believe in you!"
     </li>
   </ol>
</div>
